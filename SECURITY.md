# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. Do not disclose it as a public issue. This gives me time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please submit the report by email to: **bogachenkove@outlook.com**

### Information to Include in Your Report:
Please include as much detail as possible to help expedite the investigation and resolution of the issue. The following information is highly appreciated:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (including any configuration details).
- Affected versions of the software (if known).
- Any logs, screenshots, or code snippets that might be relevant.
- Suggestions for remediation (if applicable).

### Timeline and Disclosure Process:
This project is maintained by a single maintainer on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, I ask that you give me **90 days** to work on a fix before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed. After the 90-day period, I will aim to provide a detailed security patch, if the issue hasn't been resolved.

- **Initial response**: You will receive an acknowledgement within 48 hours of your submission.
- **Investigation period**: I will investigate the reported issue and work on fixing it. I will keep you updated on the progress.
- **Fix deployment**: Once the fix is ready, it will be included in the next release. If necessary, I will issue a patch for critical issues sooner.

### Security Updates and Patches:
- All **security-related updates** and patches will be documented in the project's release notes.
- You can monitor updates via the **Changelog** or by following the **GitHub repository** to receive notifications when a security fix is deployed.
  
### Avoid Public Disclosure Until Fixed:
Please refrain from posting the vulnerability publicly (e.g., GitHub issues, forums, or social media) before a fix is available. Early public exposure of a vulnerability can lead to exploitation, and your cooperation in keeping it private helps protect other users.

### Security Best Practices:
- Always ensure you're using the **latest stable version** of the software. Older versions may contain unresolved security issues.
- For highly sensitive environments, consider performing **regular security audits** or using **automated tools** to detect vulnerabilities in the software.

### Key Principles:
- **Responsible disclosure**: This project values responsible reporting and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Thank you for helping make the project safer for everyone!
- **Commitment to user privacy**: Any vulnerabilities reported will be addressed in a manner that protects the privacy and safety of users. Personal data, if affected by the vulnerability, will be handled with utmost care.

Thank you for your cooperation and for helping improve the security of this project!
